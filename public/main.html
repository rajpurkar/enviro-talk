                            With the internet approaching the status of a fundamental human right, it is expected to amass a user base of the entirety of the human population. With preparations to provide such access come the challenges of handling the growing population of internet users. These challenges include the growing demand for storing user data, and serving users data, problems heightened by the growing online footprint of existing users, and increased demand for cloud computing solutions. In our project, we explore the ramifications of these upcoming digital challenges in our physical environment, examine the costs of handling such challenges with traditional approaches, and propose feasible solutions designed to gracefully tackle this problem.

                        <h1> Traditional Data Centers, and their Deficiencies </h1>

                        <p>
                            The current approach to data storage involves the traditional site-constructed data centers.  Whether is be a single room or a floor of a whole building, the data centers are home to many servers that process data.

                        </p>
                        The standard building components include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Payload/Data Hall areas</strong>: “provides the underlying spatial area to house data processing and communications equipment”
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Infrastructure areas</strong>: “provides the required underlying power and cooling capacity to support the payload, data halls, and facility as a whole”
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Ancillary areas:</strong> “represent the overhead required by practice, business need, or code to be able to occupy and operate the facility”
                            </li>

                        </ul>

                    <h1>From a Critical Point of View</h1>
                    <h2>Electricity</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since data must be available to users at all hours of the day, the data centers are run at all times.  The New York Times found that data centers can waste 90% or more of the electricity that they get from the grid and that data centers worldwide use approximately 30 billions watts of electricity, equivalent to the output of 30 nuclear power plants.   The EPA estimates that data centers account for about 1.5% of the total US electricity consumption and around .5% of the greenhouse gas emissions.
                        Peter Gross, a data center designer, stated that “a single data center can take more power than a medium-size town.”  An analysis by McKinsey & Company discovered that data centers only used 6-12% of their electricity powering their servers to perform computations.  The rest of the electricity was used to keep servers idling so that they could be used if there was a sudden surge in traffic and activity.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Excessive Back-up Measures</h2>
                    <p>
                        With their reputations on the line, businesses that require servers cannot afford to have their systems down for even a second. As a precautionary measure for a power failure, many data centers have generators, which emit diesel exhaust and violates many clear air regulations. Furthermore, large data centers sometimes contain large flywheels and/or lead-acid batteries to power the computers in the case of a grid failure.
                    According to Emerson Network Power, data centers average 2.5 complete outages per year with an average time being 134 minutes.  With 500,000+ data centers, these outages  equate to 2.8 million of hours of downtime and $425 billion of dollars lost each year.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Temperature Regulation</h2>
                    <p>
                        The temperature in the data centers must remain between 18-27 degrees Celsius (64-81 degrees Celsius) and a maximum humidity of 60%.  The electrical power used by the equipment heats the air, and unless there is a functional cooling system, the hot ambient temperature can cause an electronic equipment malfunction.  If there is too much humidity, then the water can start to condense on internal components; on the other hand, if there is too little humidity, then there can be static electricity discharge problems that can also damage components.  With the equipment having such a high sensitivity to their location and temperature, the data centers must spend more energy and electricity on temperature regulation and cooling systems.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Typically custom-designed for the particular company, they tend to have multiple designs which, while allowing for innovative approaches to cooling and power systems, can also make data center environmental regulations and standards difficult to define and regulate.

                        <h1>Modular Data Centers - The Road Ahead?</h1>

                        <p>
                            In contrast to the traditional data centers, the modular data centers are pre-engineered and scalable; they consist of standardized components, which makes them cheaper, easier to build, and better designed to meet specifications and regulations. Though they are pre-fabricated, they are much more flexible than traditional data centers in that they can be shipped or retrofitted anywhere.

                        <h2>Water-Based Data Center</h2>
                        <p>
                            In addition to the cost of the property being significantly less out at sea than on land, the “water-based data center” is also a more environmentally-friendly solution than the traditional data center.  The water-based data centers are located 5-7 miles offshore in water 50-70 meters deep and consist of a computer data center, a wave-based electrical generator, and sea-water cooling units.  The ocean itself is a temperature regulator, so the data center can spend less energy in regulating its internal temperature and humidity.  Also, being situated on floating platforms and support system allows this type of data center to have easy access to ocean water for cooling and wave-generated energy.

                        <h2>Blade Server</h2>
                        <p>

                            A server with component removed to minimize the physical space and energy it uses, the blade server is an improvement from the standard servers today.  They use half of the space (can fit 128 blade servers in a space that can hold only 42 standard servers) and have a self-contained power, cooling, management, and connections systems.  They have the benefit of less rack space and simplified cabling, and with its shared cooling and power systems, it means it does not generate as much heat as traditional servers.

    <h2>How Quasar works</h2>
    Currently programmers reserve server space and resources. However, programmers tend to overestimate the number of computer servers or computing cores that their software will need by as much as 5x-10x.  As a result, even virtualized machines can work at as little as 20 percent their actual capacity. <br/>
Quasar improves on the efficiency of how servers are utilized.  By taking advantage of software similar to Netflix's and Amazon's recommendation engines (Collaborative Filtering), server allocation is distributed based on what will be ideal for the application being run.<br/>
Quasar asks programmers to state the type of parameters that a program might run, like the frequency in milliseconds that data should move.  Given these parameters, Quasar examines the program involved and matches it to the optimal performance of similar programs operating under similar workloads.<br/>
Quasar recommends the minimum number of servers to use for each application and states which applications can run best together.<br/>
The result is that entire data centers have been made to run at approximately 70-75 percent capacity.<br/>
Professor Kozyrakis has achieved utilization rates in this 70 percent range in a 200-server test bed. Currently, he is working to scale to data centers with tens of thousands of servers with applications that span across multiple data centers.<br/>
