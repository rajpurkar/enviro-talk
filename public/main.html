                            With the internet approaching the status of a fundamental human right, it is expected to amass a user base of the entirety of the human population. With preparations to provide such access come the challenges of handling the growing population of internet users. These challenges include the growing demand for storing user data, and serving users data-  problems heightened by the growing online footprint of existing users, and increased demand for cloud computing solutions. In our project, we explore the ramifications of these upcoming digital challenges in our physical environment, examine the costs of handling such challenges with traditional approaches, and propose feasible solutions designed to gracefully tackle this problem.

                            There are an estimated 1 billion people on the internet today. On average, an
                            American teenager spends three hours each day on the internet. Although in other
                            countries, this number is smaller, the internet population is growing,

                            Access to the internet is starting to be considered a fundamental human right. Several ongoing initiatives, such as the one by Mark Zuckerberg, aim to provide everyone access to the internet.

                            It has been predicted that in 20 years, we can expect to have more than thrice the current user base on the internet.
                            With the increase in importance of cloud computing, we can expect each user
                            to be storing more data online, instead of locally.

                            The problem we face is: How do we serve the exponentially increasing internet user population?

                            We simply do not have the infrastructure to be able to handle such a load.

                            Vint Cerf, often termed the father of the internet, in his vision of the internet, says “The world’s population will probably have peaked at nine billion by 2050.” Hence once we have solved it, we are done for some time.

                        <h1> Traditional Data Centers, and their Deficiencies </h1>

                        <p>
                            The current approach to data storage involves the traditional site-constructed data centers.  Whether it be a single room or a floor of a whole building, the data centers are home to many servers that process data.

                        </p>
                        The standard building components include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Payload/Data Hall areas</strong>: “provides the underlying spatial area to house data processing and communications equipment”
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Infrastructure areas</strong>: “provides the required underlying power and cooling capacity to support the payload, data halls, and facility as a whole”
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Ancillary areas:</strong> “represent the overhead required by practice, business need, or code to be able to occupy and operate the facility”
                            </li>

                        <h1>From a Critical Point of View</h1>
                        <h2>Electricity</h2>
                        <p>
                            Since data must be available to users at all hours of the day, the data centers are run at all times.  The New York Times found that data centers can waste 90% or more of the electricity that they get from the grid and that data centers worldwide use approximately 30 billions watts of electricity, equivalent to the output of 30 nuclear power plants.   The EPA estimates that data centers account for about 1.5% of the total US electricity consumption and around .5% of the greenhouse gas emissions.
                            Peter Gross, a data center designer, stated that “a single data center can take more power than a medium-size town.”  An analysis by McKinsey & Company discovered that data centers only used 6-12% of their electricity powering their servers to perform computations.  The rest of the electricity was used to keep servers idling so that they could be used if there was a sudden surge in traffic and activity.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Excessive Back-up Measures</h2>
                        <p>
                            With their reputations on the line, businesses that require servers cannot afford to have their systems down for even a second. As a precautionary measure for a power failure, many data centers have generators, which emit diesel exhaust and violates many clear air regulations. Furthermore, large data centers sometimes contain large flywheels and/or lead-acid batteries to power the computers in the case of a grid failure.
                            According to Emerson Network Power, data centers average 2.5 complete outages per year with an average time being 134 minutes.  With 500,000+ data centers, these outages  equate to 2.8 million of hours of downtime and $425 billion of dollars lost each year.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Temperature Regulation</h2>
                        <p>
                            The temperature in the data centers must remain between 18-27 degrees Celsius (64-81 degrees Fahrenheit) and a maximum humidity of 60%.  The electrical power used by the equipment heats the air, and unless there is a functional cooling system, the hot ambient temperature can cause an electronic equipment malfunction.  If there is too much humidity, then the water can start to condense on internal components; on the other hand, if there is too little humidity, then there can be static electricity discharge problems that can also damage components.  With the equipment having such a high sensitivity to their location and temperature, the data centers must spend more energy and electricity on temperature regulation and cooling systems.
                        </p>

                        <h3> With global warming being such a prevalent issue in today’s society, there are increasingly stringent federal regulations on emissions. </h3>
                        <p>
                            California is required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, which would require reducing emissions by 2-3% every year.  Companies can obtain permits (initially $13 for every 13 metric tons of gases emitted), and these permits can be sold to other companies who are having trouble cutting back on their emissions.  The trickle-down effect reaches the data centers because they rely on massive amounts of electricity.
                        </p>

                        <h2> Can we do it? </h2>
                        <h3> Yes, we can. </h3>
                        <p>
                            The Precourt Institute for Energy at Stanford University predicts that data centers can reduce their carbon emissions by 80% through improving IT device efficiency and by an additional 8% through better facility energy management.

                        <p>
                            In addition to the cost of the property being significantly less out at sea than on land, the “water-based data center” is also a more environmentally-friendly solution than the traditional data center.  The water-based data centers are located 5-7 miles offshore in water 50-70 meters deep and consist of a computer data center, a wave-based electrical generator, and sea-water cooling units.  The ocean itself is a temperature regulator, so the data center can spend less energy in regulating its internal temperature and humidity.  Also, being situated on floating platforms and support system allows this type of data center to have easy access to ocean water for cooling and wave-generated energy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The wave-generated energy is usually generated using Pelamis systems (http://www.pelamiswave.com/).  These machines consist of 5 tube sections that are connected by joints that move in the vertical directions.  Half-submerged in the water, the Pelamis system faces into the waves so that as the machine passes over the water and the sections bend in the water; the resulting movement is converted into electricity by the hydraulic power systems inside each of the joints of the Pelamis machine.  These power systems consist of hydraulic cylinders that pump high pressure oil through hydraulic motors, which drive electrical generators that have a 70% conversion efficiency.  Subsea cables can then transfer the electricity to the data center.

                            A server with components removed to minimize the physical space and energy it uses, the blade server is an improvement from the standard servers today.  They contain only the core processing units and are usually specialized so each blade handles a single task.  They use half of the space compared to standard servers (can fit 128 blade servers in a space that can hold only 42 standard servers) and fit into an enclosure with other blades so that they have self-contained power, cooling, management, and connections systems.  As a result of their configuration, blade servers use 20% less power.  They have the benefit of less rack space and up to 85% less cabling, and with its shared cooling and power systems, it means it does not generate as much heat as traditional servers.

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Currently programmers reserve server space and resources. However, programmers tend to overestimate the number of computer servers or computing cores that their software will need by as much as 5x-10x.  As a result, even virtualized machines can work at as little as 20 percent their actual capacity. </h4>
                        <li>
                            Quasar improves on the efficiency of how servers are utilized.  By taking advantage of software similar to Netflix's and Amazon's recommendation engines (Collaborative Filtering), server allocation is distributed based on what will be ideal for the application being run. </h4>
                        <li>
                            Quasar asks programmers to state the type of parameters that a program might run, like the frequency in milliseconds that data should move.  Given these parameters, Quasar examines the program involved and matches it to the optimal performance of similar programs operating under similar workloads. </h4>
                        <li>
                            Quasar recommends the minimum number of servers to use for each application and states which applications can run best together. </h4>
                        <li>
                            The result is that entire data centers have been made to run at approximately 70-75 percent capacity. </h4>

                            Professor Kozyrakis has achieved utilization rates in this 70 percent range in a 200-server test bed. Currently, he is working to scale to data centers with tens of thousands of servers with applications that span across multiple data centers. </h4>

                        <h2>What’s preventing us from using these solutions? (a.k.a. Implications)</h2>
                        <p>

                            Though each of the hardware and software solutions have their benefits, whether it be creating more eco-friendly data centers or increasing server capacity, we must still analyze the implications of each of these possible solutions.

                            Water-based data centers, being based out at sea, raise a unique set of questions relative to the traditional data centers on land.  How will water-based data centers impact the surrounding sea life?  Will it affect the ships and other water activities?  Some people would say that having a floating data center could be an eyesore and could also be more susceptible to storms and natural disasters. Others are against these data centers because they require extra maintenance for the damages resulting from the salty waters. In addition, in 2007, Google filed a patent for “water-based data centers”, which could be a daunting obstacle for many other companies and dissuade its extensive use.

                            Blade servers, though they are more space and energy-efficient than the traditional rack servers, there is still the problem that they are more expensive.  Unless the companies invest in large quantities of blade servers so that they can be slotted into large compartments and share a single power and temperature regulating system, blade servers can be more expensive than other servers.  As companies wish to minimize utility costs as much as possible, they often overlook blade servers because of their financial constraints.
